name: alphafold-database
description: "Retrieve and analyze AlphaFold predicted structures for a protein. Use when the user provides a specific UniProt Accession ID and wants structural confidence metrics (pLDDT), domain boundary analysis, or disorder assessment. Do not use if the user only has a protein name, gene name, or amino acid sequence — ask for a UniProt ID first."

# AlphaFold Database

## Overview

AlphaFold DB is a public repository of AI-predicted 3D protein structures for over 200 million proteins, maintained by DeepMind and EMBL-EBI. Access structure predictions with confidence metrics, download coordinate files, retrieve bulk datasets, and integrate predictions into computational workflows.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when working with AI-predicted protein structures in scenarios such as:

- Retrieving protein structure predictions by UniProt ID or protein name
- Downloading PDB/mmCIF coordinate files for structural analysis
- Analyzing prediction confidence metrics (pLDDT, PAE) to assess reliability
- Accessing bulk proteome datasets via Google Cloud Platform
- Comparing predicted structures with experimental data
- Performing structure-based drug discovery or protein engineering
- Building structural models for proteins lacking experimental structures
- Integrating AlphaFold predictions into computational pipelines

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Searching and Retrieving Predictions

**Using Biopython (Recommended):**

The Biopython library provides the simplest interface for retrieving AlphaFold structures:

```python
from Bio.PDB import alphafold_db

# Get all predictions for a UniProt accession
predictions = list(alphafold_db.get_predictions("P00520"))

# Download structure file (mmCIF format)
for prediction in predictions:
    cif_file = alphafold_db.download_cif_for(prediction, directory="./structures")
    print(f"Downloaded: {cif_file}")

# Get Structure objects directly
from Bio.PDB import MMCIFParser
structures = list(alphafold_db.get_structural_models_for("P00520"))
```

**Direct API Access:**

Query predictions using REST endpoints:

```python
import requests

# Get prediction metadata for a UniProt accession
uniprot_id = "P00520"
api_url = f"https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/api/prediction/{uniprot_id}"
response = requests.get(api_url)
prediction_data = response.json()

# Extract AlphaFold ID
alphafold_id = prediction_data[0]['entryId']
print(f"AlphaFold ID: {alphafold_id}")
```

**Using UniProt to Find Accessions:**

Search UniProt to find protein accessions first:

```python
import urllib.parse, urllib.request

def get_uniprot_ids(query, query_type='PDB_ID'):
    """Query UniProt to get accession IDs"""
    url = 'https://www.uniprot.org/uploadlists/'
    params = {
        'from': query_type,
        'to': 'ACC',
        'format': 'txt',
        'query': query
    }
    data = urllib.parse.urlencode(params).encode('ascii')
    with urllib.request.urlopen(urllib.request.Request(url, data)) as response:
        return response.read().decode('utf-8').splitlines()
